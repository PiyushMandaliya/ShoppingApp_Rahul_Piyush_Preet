Shopping App is WPF desktop application, which is developed in C# using XAML for UI design, which allows customer users and admin users to log in.

Each customer has their own personal shopping cart. A customer is able to view products in the store’s inventory, to add and remove products from their cart, to empty their cart, to change product quantities in their cart, to view their cart’s totals, and to check out.

Admin can manage the category and manage product by the category.
